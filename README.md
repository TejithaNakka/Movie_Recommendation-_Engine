# Movie_Recommendation_Engine
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System. It is designed using some Machine Learning Concepts like data pre-processing.This project is built using python. I used a jupyter note book for data processing.I used pycharm for the front end designing. In my project front end coding is also done using Python (Streamlit) package or a python library:in-built.Streamlit made my work easy to complete and always made accurate output for the front end design. I used a select-box and timer which are in-built functions of streamlit package.
